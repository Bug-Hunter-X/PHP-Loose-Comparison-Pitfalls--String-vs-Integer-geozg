This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling.  The comparison `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, leading to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers. 

```php
<?php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not Equal";
}
?>
```

In this case, "Equal" will be printed because PHP converts the string "10" to an integer 10 before the comparison. This behavior might be unexpected if you're expecting strict type checking.
